Online ad exchanges *feel like* stock exchanges. After all, they're fast, automated, have huge daily volumes and have "exchanges" in their name. Similarly there are also large cap "stocks" made up by prime internet properties such as youtube, facebook, instagram, twitter wherein one can find users who might be interested in something you'd like to sell. 
## Ad market scale
Here are some numbers to contextualize the size of the ad market:
- NYSE has about 8000 stocks 
- There are about 300 million companies in the world.
- eBay has about 1 billion active listings 

There are 5 billion internet users, with over 100 page views per person in a day in the US. There can be about 10 ads on a page, meaning that the total number of ads might be close to *5 trillion* a day. This number is by no means trivial, but the problem is more than just the scale. 
### No two ad opportunities are identical 
Every ad opportunity is determined by these factors
1. Which page showing the ad? There are 1 billion websites in the world so it’s not feasible to look at each page which can feature your ad. Even in the scenario that you decide to go with one platform (e.g.  Facebook or Instagram), each user would also see a different home feed. 
2. Who’s viewing the ad? There are 5 billion internet users and it’s not always possible to figure out if users are actually the same person, just using a different device. 

### Speed is key
Compared to a stock, this is clearly an ephemeral trading opportunity in that there's an immediate need to sell the ad opportunity before the user closes the page out of frustration with slow loading times (typically this happens within milliseconds). 

Also, these ad opportunities change as quickly as internet content itself, with trends and news coming and going within hours. One ad opportunity can differ significantly from other opportunities even within the same day.

Not so fast. Here's a couple of things you need to decide (and here we'll find the 3 most important pieces of an online ad): 
1. Where is the ad being shown? Facebook, Instagram, Twitter
2. Who is the ad being shown to? Gender, Age, Location
3. What's the ad about? Size, content, link
