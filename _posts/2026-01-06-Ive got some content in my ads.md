Why do you get the kind of ads that you do, and why are there so many of them?
Here we'll look at some YouTubers to see how they make these decisions.

# I've got some content in my ads!
*Disclaimer: these opinions do not reflect those of my employer and are mine alone*

The most popular content that we see today comes with ads in some form.
As users, it's rather frustrating to have ads or sponsored content show up on your content feed.
But servers aren't free and ads are what incentivize people to produce and host content to entertain and/or inform you.

![two unskippable ads](https://img-9gag-fun.9cache.com/photo/aoy6oDX_700bwp.webp)

So what influences the quantity and type of ads you see? 

We'll do a quick recap of how ads took over the world over the last couple of decades.
In order to understand what kind of ads and how many get shown, we'll poke a bit into the revenue of some YouTubers and see what drives sponsored content on their channels.

# How ads took over the world
The OG "content" used to be newspapers that people would pay for at newspaper stands with coins.
Now ads are everywhere and all three entities mentioned in the previous sentence can be considered as endangered species.

Coincidence? I think not!

![newspaper stands](https://inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2023/05/1336747_81_118551_mbaoiLBrD-889x593.jpg)

I think it all started sometime in the 2000s, with "free" newspapers starting to show up alongside the paid ones.
Commuters started grabbing those over newspapers you'd have to pay for, even though these papers had substantially more ads.
However, it's pretty hard to beat "free", especially since the breaking news would show up in every single newspaper anyway.
The innovation here is that the revenue of these "free" newspapers comes primarily from the advertisers instead of the readers, thereby allowing these papers to scale viewership much faster than paid newspapers.

## Online advertising 
At the same time, PCs (later mobile phones and cellular plans) were also gaining popularity such that even these free newspapers started losing ground to websites.
The most visited websites operated on very similar ad-supported models, giving out content in exchange for putting some ads on the webpage that the users might click on.

Some of the scummy websites gained notoriety for flooding their pages with annoying pop-up ads and misleading buttons.
Users would often avoid these websites entirely, although they might still brave these traps and snares if they wanted the content bad enough.
Even then, we intuitively understood that the amount and type of ads on the website are related to the kind of content the website hosts...

![internet ads](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1300/0*jnk0_FJWQf_7Z4j4.jpg)

These ads underwent a major evolution, going from ad hoc partnerships between websites (i.e. publishers) and advertisers (i.e. marketers) to a whole slew of automated bidding and attribution systems over the last couple of decades.

*Aside: Online advertising also enabled user tracking, promising marketers that FINALLY, they'll be able to tell which half of their marketing spend was wasted. But realizing this promise always seemed to be one technical innovation away. We'll talk about this in another post...*

However, this amount of technical complexity is not necessary to understand what kind of ads and what type of ads gets shown to you.
Let's start by looking at Youtubers instead.

# YouTubers and sponsored content
YouTubers these days often allow YouTube itself to inject ads into their videos.
On top of those ads, many of those with big followings also run sponsored content.
We'll focus on the latter as a way to understand what dynamics influence their decisions, and hopefully we can see that the same dynamics also affect larger players like Google Search and YouTube ads.

## Does LinusTechTips have too many ads?
[@LinusTechTips](https://www.youtube.com/@LinusTechTips) (i.e. LTT) is one of the top tech YouTubers who runs a multi-million dollar digital media company making money from these YouTube channels.

A [recent rant](https://www.reddit.com/r/LinusTechTips/comments/1pztlu0/3_ad_segments_in_a_12_minute_video_is_insane/) on [r/LinusTechTips](https://www.reddit.com/r/LinusTechTips/) complained about too many ads (3 ad segments in a 13-minute video [about RAM prices](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRvyRo5Fk0o) posted on Dec 30, 2025).
The [SponsorBlock](https://sponsor.ajay.app) view shows that those ads take up almost 1/5th of the total video length, excluding the typical 2× 15-30s worth of YouTube-injected ads.

![LTT 3ads sponsorblock view](/assets/posts/2026-01-06/LTT_3ads_sponsorblock.jpg)

## How much is LTT earning per ad?
If we listen only to the viewers' feedback, then content creators will have no food on the table.
So what's the breakdown here, and how much are these ads contributing to [@LinusTechTips](https://www.youtube.com/@LinusTechTips)'s top line?
LTT doesn't provide explicit figures, but they've dropped a bunch of (publicly available) breadcrumbs for us:
* They quoted a $100 million valuation figure for a potential acquisition back in 2023. This is typically a multiple of yearly revenue. The multiple for digital media can reach 10×.
* In their [revenue breakdowns video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GeCP-0nuziE), we [see percentages](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GeCP-0nuziE&t=106). AdSense (i.e., YouTube-injected ads) only makes up about 14% of their revenue, and most of their revenue comes from their "merch" (i.e., products from their team, making up 55% of the revenue) and sponsorships (i.e., third-party products or services, making up 21%). 
* Also in that video, some isolated AdSense figures were shown. Their biggest standard video earned [\$2k per million views](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GeCP-0nuziE&t=375), whereas their biggest "Short" earned only [$100 per million views](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GeCP-0nuziE&t=365).
* The channel had about [850 million views](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GeCP-0nuziE&t=447), so this means that AdSense can be up to ~$1.5 million. Since AdSense makes up 14% of revenue, we get a rough estimate of **yearly revenue at ~$10 million**, which aligns with the 10× multiple for their acquisition valuation figures in 2023.

Let's look at the ad spots again in the 13-minute video [about RAM prices](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRvyRo5Fk0o), which got 1.3 million views as of 2025-01-06, and assume (unrealistically) that their yearly revenue gets broken down proportionally by view counts:
1. DBrand, their channel sponsor: Sponsorships (21% of revenue) ~$2k
2. Clear LTT screwdrivers (merch, 55% of revenue) ~$10k
3. Private Internet Access: Sponsorships (21% of revenue) ~$2k
4. AdSense (14% of revenue) ~$1.3k

From LTT's perspective, they can expect **up to $15k worth of revenue** from these ads, which absolutely explains why these ads are there—so why don't they add more ads?

# Long-term ad revenue depends on viewers
The growth of viewership is essential to the long-term viability of those ads on the YouTube channel.
Higher viewership is directly correlated with influence that LTT can choose to resell to advertisers who may be interested in telling viewers about their newest product or service.

Too many ads would risk the channel losing viewership and thereby influence, resulting in fewer advertisers who want to have an opportunity to get featured in an LTT video.
Revisiting the topic of [3 ad segments in a 12-minute video](https://www.reddit.com/r/LinusTechTips/comments/1pztlu0/3_ad_segments_in_a_12_minute_video_is_insane/), we can see little evidence of a dampening to their long-term subscribership around the time of video release on Dec 30, 2025, according to [SocialBlade.com](https://socialblade.com/youtube/handle/linustechtips).

![LTT Total subs increasing consistently](/assets/posts/2026-01-06/LTT_total_subs.png)

The only major dip in subscriber count was in July 2023, when they were mired in controversy due to an exposé by a competing YouTube channel, throwing their ethics into question and hurting viewer trust according to [this CBC report](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/linus-tech-tips-youtube-controversy-1.6940087).
This, of course, endangered their ad revenue and long-term viability as a digital media company, prompting an [apology video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cTpTMl8kFY) in which they promised a multitude of measures to win back viewer trust and credibility.

*Aside: These counts could be lower if ad blockers like [AdGuard](https://adguard.com/en/welcome.html) (skips YouTube-injected ads) or [SponsorBlock](https://sponsor.ajay.app) (skips sponsored segments) did not exist. When LTT pitches to advertisers, it would be in their interest to point to these counts without the above caveat.*

## But it also depends on advertisers
Somewhat counter-intuitively, viewership is more a measure of cost rather than revenue for YouTubers.
High-quality content, while almost always correlated with high viewership, is certainly guaranteed to burn a hole in the pocket.

Luckily for us, LTT has another video detailing that [an average video might take up to 60 hours](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us7qSE44XOg) of work to produce.
Assuming that their staff gets paid $20 per hour, this means a lower limit of $1,800 per video (good thing they seem to come out profitable!).

![60 hours of work per video](/assets/posts/2026-01-06/LTT_hours_of_work_per_video.png)

The hole needs to be balanced out by ad revenue if the YouTube channel has any hope of being able to continue making content in the long term.
So how do marketers or advertisers decide how much money to throw at YouTube channels?

If you've heard of the [Drake equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_equation), the answer is surprisingly simple:

> Amount of marketing dollars ~ Number of Views * Probability of (Incremental) Purchase per View * Amount of Revenue per Purchase

However, also similar to the [Drake equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_equation), the real complexity arises in the terms of the equation itself rather than the equation. 
* Number of Views - It's usually hard to predict how many views the video will get prior to the video release, although proxies such as subscriber count and viewership of similar past videos can be good alternatives.
* Probability of (Incremental) Purchase per View - This is the likelihood of a purchase after watching the video that wouldn't have happened otherwise. The computation of this number is the most complex part of ad attribution and can be difficult to estimate in a statistically sound way. This is also why there's typically a discount code that YouTubers will ask you to use—to make it easier for marketers to estimate this figure.
* Amount of Revenue per Purchase - High ticket items such as cars can justify higher marketing budgets, which is why some automotive Youtubers do not need as much views to survive.

Here's the sneaky part—YouTubers are still incentivized to drive more sales for advertisers because doing so successfully means higher marketing budgets in the future (if the marketers are also doing a good job)—without losing viewers, that is.

*Aside: For LTT, it is in their interest to discourage their viewers from using ad blockers (e.g., by claiming [AdBlock is theft](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=a-PH2GUy_zM&t=71)) even if they risk alienating their viewers.*

# When is an ad not an ad?
Fixing the above variables, the last element of the game is to increase the amount of ad slots in the video. 
Going back to the topic of [3 ad segments in a 12-minute video](https://www.reddit.com/r/LinusTechTips/comments/1pztlu0/3_ad_segments_in_a_12_minute_video_is_insane/), we see that LTT went with two strategies to increase viewer retention:
1. Strategic ad placement - clustering these ads after the "hook" (when interest in the main content is high) and after the main content is a common strategy to balance watch times and ad load. This can also lead to sneaky ads for some less ethical channels. I'll skip this section since the best practices are format-dependent (i.e., the same strategy for standard YouTube videos may not work for TikTok, YouTube Shorts, or other types of media).
2. Relevant and high-quality ads - ideally the ads are relevant to the users. LTT viewers are typically tech enthusiasts and are already likely to be interested in related topics such as DBrand phone cases (with phone circuit board skins), LTT screwdrivers (marketed as being built for PC builders), and PIA (VPN for the privacy conscious). Ads which are less relevant to the audience can reduce the ad volume, however. For example, [this Dyson sponsored video being one of the most disliked](https://www.reddit.com/r/LinusTechTips/comments/15i23rk/what_is_ltts_most_disliked_video/#:~:text=They%20didn't%20put%20it,would%20be%20nothing%20but%20Dyson.).

But if the ad is so relevant to viewers interests and high quality, what makes it different from the main content that the Youtube channel is producing anyway?
In that case, why would an advertiser even need to pay to be in the video?

## Goldilocks zone of ad relevance
We can plot two lines on the horizontal axis of third-party content (3PC) relevance, differentiating it from ads since ads are typically paid for.
1. Willingness of third party (i.e., advertiser, 3P) to pay for placement of the 3PC.
2. Likelihood of content producer featuring the content without 3P having to pay.

![Goldilocks zone of advertising](/assets/posts/2026-01-06/goldilocks_zone_of_advertising.png)

So the middle part is where ad revenue comes from, satisfying both conditions:
* Not so relevant that creators would want to feature the content anyway regardless of the advertiser paying (i.e., Probability of (Incremental) Purchase per View is low). Examples of this include product reviews for channels featuring gear discussions such as photography channels covering a new camera launch.
* Not so low-quality or irrelevant to risk long-term viewership (e.g., scam content or low-quality product). There are also channels such as [@Coffeezilla](https://www.youtube.com/Coffeezilla) who make a living out of exposing unethical sponsorships, which is an interesting meta play.

This is why the strategy for creators hovers around maximizing the use of this zone through the following mechanisms:
* Setting a baseline for 3P content: One such example comes from an indie tech YouTuber I enjoy, [@BeccaFarsace](https://www.youtube.com/@BeccaFarsace), who publicly shares guidelines [in this video about sponsorships](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PME4LZMDtK0) such as "No paid reviews", "Feeling comfortable with her audience spending money on featured products", "Not reviewing a device during a brand-sponsored trip" to build trust with her audience as well as to set expectations upfront with advertisers.
* Audience-based Relevance: The ad doesn't have to be limited to the content that it is being featured alongside. As long as some proportion of viewers can be expected to stay tuned, it's likely the ad stands a chance of being featured. YouTube shares aggregate demographic data such as gender, age, broad geographical distribution, as well as (topic-based) interests of channel audiences, which makes this easier. For example, a video [about RAM prices](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRvyRo5Fk0o) featuring ads for screwdrivers and a VPN may be a good idea because PC builders are likely to be interested in both. However, a DBrand ad (a phone case or skin maker) is also fair game because the audience (i.e., young, male) may also be interested in protecting their phones with some edgy skins.
* High-quality ads: You've seen good ads, and the best of them seem to transcend the product they're selling. This example from LTT shows that at the very least, they're [trying](https://youtu.be/3yO0m8X0xn4?si=ImkTR22omqaHSCjm&t=490).

# TL;DR
To recap:
1. Ads are necessary evils as a result of free content.
2. Creators must balance ad density with viewer retention.
3. Amount of marketing dollars ~ Number of Views × Probability of (Incremental) Purchase per View × Amount of Revenue per Purchase
4. High-quality, relevant ads are more tolerable and effective than irrelevant ones.
5. Effective advertising lives in a middle ground—content that is relevant enough to interest viewers, but not so central that the creator would have covered it for free.
