Why do you get the kind of ads that you do, and why are there so many of them?
Here, we'll look at some YouTubers to see how they make these decisions.

# I've got some content in my ads!
*Disclaimer: These opinions do not reflect those of my employer and are mine alone.*

The most popular content that we see today comes with ads in some form.
As users, it's rather frustrating to have ads or sponsored content show up on your content feed.
But servers aren't free and ads are what incentivize people to produce and host content to entertain and/or inform you.

![two unskippable ads](https://img-9gag-fun.9cache.com/photo/aoy6oDX_700bwp.webp)

So what influences the quantity and type of ads you see? 

We'll do a quick recap of how ads took over the world over the last couple of decades.
To understand what kind of ads and how many get shown, we'll examine the revenue of some YouTubers and see what drives sponsored content on their channels.

# How ads took over the world
The OG "content" used to be newspapers that people would pay for at newspaper stands with coins.
Now ads are everywhere and all three entities mentioned in the previous sentence can be considered as endangered species.

Coincidence? I think not!

![newspaper stands](https://inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2023/05/1336747_81_118551_mbaoiLBrD-889x593.jpg)

I think it all started sometime in the 2000s, with "free" newspapers starting to show up alongside the paid ones.
Commuters started grabbing those over newspapers you'd have to pay for, even though these papers had substantially more ads.
However, it's pretty hard to beat "free", especially since the breaking news would show up in every single newspaper anyway.
The innovation here is that the revenue of these "free" newspapers comes primarily from advertisers instead of readers, thereby allowing these papers to scale viewership much faster than paid newspapers.

## Online advertising
At the same time, PCs (later mobile phones and cellular plans) were also gaining popularity such that even these free newspapers started losing ground to websites.
The most visited websites operated on very similar ad-supported models, giving out content in exchange for putting some ads on the webpage that the users might click on.

Some of the scummy websites gained notoriety for flooding their pages with annoying pop-up ads and misleading buttons.
Users would often avoid these websites entirely, although they might still brave these traps and snares if they wanted the content bad enough.
Even then, we intuitively understood that the amount and type of ads on a website are related to the kind of content the website hosts.

![internet ads](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1300/0*jnk0_FJWQf_7Z4j4.jpg)

These ads underwent a major evolution, going from ad hoc partnerships between websites (i.e. publishers) and advertisers (i.e. marketers) to a whole slew of automated bidding and attribution systems over the last couple of decades.

![lumascape display ads](https://bidscube.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/6231d4f89bb3333c82c7f9ed_Ad-Exchange.png)

*Aside: Online advertising also enabled user tracking, promising marketers that FINALLY, they'll be able to tell which half of their marketing spend was wasted. But realizing this promise always seemed to be one technical innovation away. We'll talk about this in another post.*

However, this amount of technical complexity is not necessary to understand what kind of ads and what type of ads gets shown to you.
Let's start by looking at Youtubers instead.

# YouTubers and sponsored content
YouTubers these days often allow YouTube itself to inject ads into their videos.
On top of those ads, many of those with big followings also run sponsored content.
We'll focus on the latter to understand what influences their decisions, because these are tradeoffs made by the creators themselves, not by a black-box optimization like AdSense.
However, the same tradeoffs apply to automated ad systems.

## Does LinusTechTips have too many ads?
[@LinusTechTips](https://www.youtube.com/@LinusTechTips) (i.e. LTT) is one of the top tech YouTubers who runs a multi-million dollar digital media company making money from these YouTube channels.

A [recent rant](https://www.reddit.com/r/LinusTechTips/comments/1pztlu0/3_ad_segments_in_a_12_minute_video_is_insane/) on [r/LinusTechTips](https://www.reddit.com/r/LinusTechTips/) complained about too many ads: 3 ad segments in a 13-minute video [about RAM prices](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRvyRo5Fk0o) posted on Dec 30, 2025.
The [SponsorBlock](https://sponsor.ajay.app) view shows that those ads take up almost 1/5th of the total video length, excluding the typical 2× 15-30s worth of YouTube-injected ads.

![LTT 3ads sponsorblock view](/assets/posts/2026-01-06/LTT_3ads_sponsorblock.jpg)

## How much is LTT earning per ad?
If we listened only to viewers' feedback, content creators would have no food on the table.
So what's the breakdown, and how much are these ads contributing to [@LinusTechTips](https://www.youtube.com/@LinusTechTips)'s top line?
LTT doesn't provide explicit figures, but they've dropped a bunch of (publicly available) breadcrumbs for us:
* They quoted a $100 million valuation figure for a potential acquisition back in 2023. This is typically a multiple of yearly revenue. The multiple for digital media can reach 10×.
* In their [revenue breakdowns video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GeCP-0nuziE), we [see percentages](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GeCP-0nuziE&t=106). AdSense (i.e., YouTube-injected ads) only makes up about 14% of their revenue, and most of their revenue comes from their "merch" (i.e., products from their team, making up 55% of the revenue) and sponsorships (i.e., third-party products or services, making up 21%). 
* Also in that video, some isolated AdSense figures were shown. Their biggest standard video earned [\$2k per million views](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GeCP-0nuziE&t=375), whereas their biggest "Short" earned only [$100 per million views](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GeCP-0nuziE&t=365).
* The channel had about [850 million views](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GeCP-0nuziE&t=447), so this means that AdSense can be up to ~$1.5 million. Since AdSense makes up 14% of revenue, we get a rough estimate of **yearly revenue at ~$10 million**, which aligns with the 10× multiple for their acquisition valuation figures in 2023.

Let's look at the ad spots again in the 13-minute video [about RAM prices](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRvyRo5Fk0o), which got 1.3 million views as of Jan 6, 2025, and assume (unrealistically) that their yearly revenue gets broken down proportionally by view counts:
1. DBrand, their channel sponsor: Sponsorships (21% of revenue) ~$2k
2. Clear LTT screwdrivers (merch, 55% of revenue) ~$10k
3. Private Internet Access: Sponsorships (21% of revenue) ~$2k
4. AdSense (14% of revenue) ~$1.3k

From LTT's perspective, they can expect **up to $15k in revenue** from these ads, which absolutely explains why these ads are there—so why don't they add more ads?

# Long-term ad revenue depends on viewers
The growth of viewership is essential to the long-term viability of those ads on the YouTube channel.
Higher viewership is directly correlated with the influence that LTT can resell to advertisers who may be interested in telling viewers about their newest product or service.

Too many ads would risk the channel losing viewership and thereby influence, resulting in fewer advertisers who want to have an opportunity to get featured in an LTT video.
Revisiting the topic of [3 ad segments in a 12-minute video](https://www.reddit.com/r/LinusTechTips/comments/1pztlu0/3_ad_segments_in_a_12_minute_video_is_insane/), we can see little evidence of dampening in their long-term subscribership around the time of the video's release on Dec 30, 2025, according to [SocialBlade.com](https://socialblade.com/youtube/handle/linustechtips).

![LTT Total subs increasing consistently](/assets/posts/2026-01-06/LTT_total_subs.png)

The only major dip in subscriber count was in July 2023, when they were mired in controversy due to an exposé by a competing YouTube channel, throwing their ethics into question and hurting viewer trust according to [this CBC report](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/linus-tech-tips-youtube-controversy-1.6940087).
This endangered their ad revenue and long-term viability as a digital media company, prompting an [apology video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cTpTMl8kFY) in which they promised a multitude of measures to win back viewer trust and credibility.

*Aside: These counts could be lower if ad blockers like [AdGuard](https://adguard.com/en/welcome.html) (skips YouTube-injected ads) or [SponsorBlock](https://sponsor.ajay.app) (skips sponsored segments) did not exist. When LTT pitches to advertisers, it would be in their interest to point to these counts without the above caveat.*

## But viewership is not ad revenue
Somewhat counter-intuitively, viewership is more a measure of cost rather than revenue for YouTubers.
High-quality content, while almost always correlated with high viewership, is certainly guaranteed to burn a hole in the pocket.

Luckily for us, LTT has another video detailing that [an average video might take up to 60 hours](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us7qSE44XOg) of work to produce.
Assuming their staff gets paid $20 per hour, this means a lower limit of $1,800 per video (good thing they seem to come out profitable!).

![60 hours of work per video](/assets/posts/2026-01-06/LTT_hours_of_work_per_video.png)

The hole needs to be balanced out by ad revenue if the YouTube channel has any hope of being able to continue making content in the long term.
So how do marketers or advertisers decide how much money to throw at YouTube channels?

## Drake equation for marketing budgets
If you've heard of the [Drake equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_equation), the answer is surprisingly simple:

> Amount of marketing dollars ~ Number of Views * Probability of (Incremental) Purchase per View * Amount of Revenue per Purchase

However, similar to the [Drake equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_equation), the real complexity arises in the terms of the equation itself rather than in the equation as a whole. 
* Number of Views - It's usually hard to predict how many views a video will get prior to release, although proxies such as subscriber count and viewership of similar past videos can be good alternatives.
* Probability of (Incremental) Purchase per View - This is the likelihood of a purchase after watching the video that wouldn't have happened otherwise. The computation of this number is the most complex part of ad attribution and can be difficult to estimate in a statistically sound way. This is also why there's typically a discount code that YouTubers will ask you to use—to make it easier for marketers to estimate this figure.
* Amount of Revenue per Purchase - High ticket items such as cars can justify higher marketing budgets, which is why some automotive Youtubers do not need as many views to survive.

Here's the sneaky part: YouTubers are still incentivized to drive more sales for advertisers because doing so successfully **means higher marketing budgets in the future** (if the marketers are also doing a good job)—without losing viewers, that is.

*Aside: For LTT, it's in their interest to discourage viewers from using ad blockers (e.g., by claiming [AdBlock is theft](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=a-PH2GUy_zM&t=71)) even if they risk alienating their viewers. That's because users who don't see ads can't meaningfully contribute to positive returns on marketing spend.*

# The game that creators play
Let's revisit the initial discussion about [3 ad segments in a 12-minute video](https://www.reddit.com/r/LinusTechTips/comments/1pztlu0/3_ad_segments_in_a_12_minute_video_is_insane/).

![LTT 3ads sponsorblock view](/assets/posts/2026-01-06/LTT_3ads_sponsorblock.jpg)

Let's recall that the creator's goal (with regard to ad load and ad types) is to:
1. Maximize the return on marketing spend to incentivize larger marketing budgets in the future.
2. Minimize the impact of these ads on long-term viewership.

The ads strategy that LTT went with is as follows:
1. **Strategic ad placement** - clustering these ads after the "hook" (when interest in the main content is high) and after the main content increases user retention.
2. **Limiting ad load** - 20% ad load is still quite normal compared to traditional TV shows, where prime-time shows can contain up to 8 minutes of ads per half hour (i.e., ~25%) [src](https://www.quora.com/How-many-commercials-are-in-a-30-minute-show#:~:text=Most%20TV%20half%2Dhour%20show,(rarely)%2060%20second%20commercials.)
3. **Relevant and high-quality ads** - ads that engage users are more likely to result in longer view lengths and reduce subscriber loss. On the flip side, ads that are less relevant to the audience can result in user frustration. For example, a Dyson sponsored video is [one of the most disliked](https://www.reddit.com/r/LinusTechTips/comments/15i23rk/what_is_ltts_most_disliked_video/#:~:text=They%20didn't%20put%20it,would%20be%20nothing%20but%20Dyson.).

The first two strategies are difficult to scale since they are constrained by the amount of content available to publish.
Even if the creator has a massive backlog of content available and resources to produce them, the amount of user attention is typically limited (there's only so much time in a day during which users watch YouTube).

*Aside: The limited amount of attention per day is the reason why most online ad campaigns attempt to evenly pace the campaign spend (i.e., make sure that spend is spread evenly across campaign dates).*

This leaves us with **relevant and high-quality ads**.

But if an ad is so relevant that it's not perceived as an ad, why would advertisers need to pay the creator?
YouTube is a free and open platform, and businesses maintain their own channels and regularly upload ads to them.

## A sweet spot between willingness to pay and relevance
In this section, we'll describe how this dynamic influences the types of ads you'll see.

We can plot two lines on the horizontal axis of third-party content (3PC) relevance, differentiating it from ads since ads are typically paid for:
1. **Willingness of third party (i.e., advertiser, 3P) to pay for placement of the 3PC** - Low-relevance 3P content can often come from bad businesses or desperate marketers, neither of which is good for long-term viewership.
2. **Likelihood of content producer featuring the content without 3P having to pay** - High-relevance 3P content is typically similar to organic content, and some creators would even pay to have access (instead of advertisers paying).

![Goldilocks zone of advertising](/assets/posts/2026-01-06/goldilocks_zone_of_advertising.png)

So the middle part (the sweet spot) is where ad revenue comes from, satisfying both conditions:
* Not so relevant that creators would want to feature the content anyway **without the advertiser having to pay** (i.e., Probability of (Incremental) Purchase per View is low). Examples include product reviews for channels featuring gear discussions, such as photography channels covering a new camera launch. Creators may even be willing to pay for access to these new products (e.g., some creators pay to attend the Consumer Electronics Show, where new and exciting tech gadgets may be released).
* Not so low-quality or irrelevant as to **risk long-term viewership** (e.g., scam content or low-quality products). Channels with scummy ads or poor ethics can also be exposed by channels such as [@Coffeezilla](https://www.youtube.com/Coffeezilla), which is an interesting meta play. An indie tech YouTuber I enjoy, [@BeccaFarsace](https://www.youtube.com/@BeccaFarsace), is upfront with [her policy for sponsorships](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PME4LZMDtK0), such as "No paid reviews," "Feeling comfortable with her audience spending money on featured products," and "Not reviewing a device during a brand-sponsored trip," to build trust with her audience and set expectations upfront with advertisers.

## Maximizing the sweet spot
Given that creators do not have direct leverage over the willingness of advertisers to pay, they have to make the best use of the sweet spot identified above.

We'll look at two examples below (with caveats).

### Better produced ads
Even if the content itself doesn't line up with the audience well, the production quality can improve the viewing experience enough to make it more watchable (than say, just reading from the advertiser-provided script).
Even obvious ads can go viral (e.g., [Long long man](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-1Ue0FFrHY)).

Here's [an example](https://youtu.be/qklfd81ceeY?si=BI8RZ1NaTepPPvQ-&t=959) from another LTT video incorporating an element from traditional TV ads: a jingle!

![LTT jingle screenshot](/assets/posts/2026-01-06/LTT_jingle_screenshot.png)

Which seemed to be received quite positively as of when I'm writing this.

![LTT jingle comments](/assets/posts/2026-01-06/LTT_jingle_comments.png)

*Aside: Better produced ads have varying degrees of success in the modern ecosystem. The days of live TV are gone, along with unskippable ads. [SponsorBlock](https://sponsor.ajay.app), for example, helps viewers skip these sections altogether. However, for other content providers such as Netflix and Twitch, unskippable ads are still here, meaning that high-quality ads might still have a shot.*

### Audience-based relevance
Ads don't have to be limited to the same topic as the main content.
Featuring ads from related or even unrelated topics that appeal to the audience increases the pool of marketing dollars eligible to bid for the ad spot, increasing the creator's revenue.

YouTube shares aggregate demographic data such as gender, age, broad geographical distribution, as well as (topic-based) interests of channel audiences, which makes this easier for creators to do this.

Let's go back to the earlier video [about RAM prices](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRvyRo5Fk0o) and revisit the sponsored ads, noting that LTT viewers are likely to be **male, young, and interested in technology**:
1. DBrand - a tech accessories brand with features that appeal to enthusiasts such as the [teardown series](https://dbrand.com/shop/limited-edition/teardown), featuring skins that expose the underlying circuit boards
2. Clear LTT screwdrivers - their [in-house screwdriver](https://global.lttstore.com/products/screwdriver?srsltid=AfmBOooUn8dXylPtUTVslNhmfRWlZdX_GEkkM-eyghsvJVCvoiMjahut), specially designed for PC builders, because they're "making the best screwdriver with PC building in mind"
3. Private Internet Access - appeals to the privacy-conscious who do not want their internet activity tracked by "nefarious actors"

[This example](https://youtu.be/3yO0m8X0xn4?si=ImkTR22omqaHSCjm&t=490) from LTT shows how they're trying to appeal to a mostly male audience with another product that's popular with males (i.e., War Thunder, a war simulation game).

![LTT warthunder ad](/assets/posts/2026-01-06/LTT_warthunder_ad.png)

*Aside: This can lead to a downward spiral as creators desperate for ad dollars may feel pressured to introduce lower-relevance ads to fill the ad spots (possibly including scummy businesses), resulting in loss of viewership, which further reduces the ad spot prices they can command.*

# TL;DR
To recap:
1. Ads are necessary evils as a result of free content.
2. Creators need to choose ads that maximize ad revenue and minimize impact on long-term viewership.
3. Ad revenue depends on marketing dollars, which ultimately depend on the profitability of the ad spot.
4. Strategic ad placements, limiting ad load, and selecting relevant ads reduce impact on long-term viewership.
5. Relevant ads are correlated with both higher profitability and lower impact on long-term viewership.
6. However, there's a tradeoff between ad relevance and advertisers' willingness to pay. This results in most featured ads being in a middle spot of ad relevance.
7. To maximize ad revenue in the sweet spot, creators can attempt strategies such as producing higher-quality ads and/or broadening the kinds of eligible ads by identifying audience interests.
