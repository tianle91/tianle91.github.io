# Non-Technical Tips for Photography Enthusiasts
- don’t keep walking. look back! 
- change your vertical height. Squat down or climb a rock.
- Photographers ephemeris 
- Waiting for the sun - number of fingers vs sun movement 
- getting closer isn’t the same as zooming in 
- puddles and reflections 
- Look for frames 
- Look for interesting light. Cloudy days generally lead to bland photos. Shadows and reflections. 
- Less is more. Sometimes over or under exposing to remove details gives a better photo
