Why do you get the kind of ads that you do and why are there so many of them?
Is there no limit to the amount of ads they can stuff in your face?
Here we'll look at a few of my favourite Youtubers as examples of how content providers make these decisions.

# I've got some content in my ads!
*Disclaimer: these opinions do not reflect those of my employer and are mine alone*

The most popular content that we see today come with ads in some form.
As users, it's rather frustrating to have ads or sponsored content show up on your content feed.
But servers aren't free and ads are what incentivize people to produce and host content to entertain and/or inform you.

![two unskippable ads](https://img-9gag-fun.9cache.com/photo/aoy6oDX_700bwp.webp)

So what influences the quantity and type of ads you see? 

We'll first backtrack a bit my looking at how the modern ad-supported business model came about.
Then we'll take a look at my favourite Youtubers and see what hints they can give us about how to fit sponsored content into their videos.
Finally we can come up with a couple of principles that are broadly applicable to most ad-supported creators or platforms.

# How ads took over the world
The OG "content" used to be newspapers that people paid physical cash for, usually at the time of purchase.

![newspaper stands](https://inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2023/05/1336747_81_118551_mbaoiLBrD-889x593.jpg)

Some time in the 2000s though, "free" newspapers started gaining traction. 
These papers had substantially more ads than traditional paid newspapers, often with as much as 50% ads in the headliner articles.
Yet, they were popular since "free" is just too good of a deal and you'll still get something to do in the train.

## Online advertising 
As PCs, then later mobile phones and cellular plans caught on, newspapers started losing more ground to websites.
While some web content were locked behind a paywall, the most successful ones were those which just gave out content for free.
Most of their revenue came from ads instead, operating on a business model similar to the "free" newspapers that we talked about earlier.

This was also a time of some genuinely annoying pop-up ads and misleading buttons, which resulted in users being really annoyed with those websites, swearing to never visit them again... not without ad blockers!
These scummy websites relied on SEO and shady deals with other equally scummy webistes to maintain a stream of new and oblivious users who can be relied on to generate clicks for which they can earn ad revenue.

![internet ads](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1300/0*jnk0_FJWQf_7Z4j4.jpg)

However, Google's [PageRank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank) algorithm, its successors as well as LLM web crawlers have increased the difficulty of diverting traffic to turd content.
Luckily for us, this means that most of the time, in order to make any money selling ads, you need to have good (enough) content to attract viewership.
But too much bad ads though, users start to flip the figurative table, click the ❌ button or maybe swear to never visit the website again.

*Aside: Online advertising also had the extra benefit of being attributable to purchase decisions, which newspaper ads weren't able to accomplish (not directly anyway, some ran surveys and questionnaires but you can image how that went). Ever heard of the old saying about marketing dollars, that "half of my marketing budget is wasted, but the problem is that I don't know which half"? Online advertising sells the promise that you can now tell which half is wasted... or can you? We'll talk about this in another post...*

# Users V Advertisers
It's certainly easy to stuff the entire webpage with ads as a quick way to maybe double or triple the ads revenue, but the gravy train would only run for a few days at most before users and search engines wise up to the sudden drop in content quality.
So how does one balance the need to sell out to pay the bills and the need to maintain or acquire an audiences with which to sell out?

Here's a rough sketch of (inter-related) decisions that need to be made:
1. How much of user attention should be resold?
2. What kind of ads should fill the monetized attention?
3. How much should advertisers pay for those ads?

Finally, how do we know if we're doing a good job?

Since these are often trade secrets, the details on how creators or platforms do this is often not available for scrutiny.
But some Youtubers (especially those who build their platform on trust and transparency) can be quite forthcoming with things like their revenue sources and dollars.
So we'll take a look at my favourite Youtube channels and how they make money.

# Youtubers and sponsored content
Youtubers tend to run ads on their videos on top of the platform inserted ads. They are a proxy of content platform because of these similarities:
1. They need to maintain viewership with some core audience segment in order to establish consistent and valuable viewership. 
2. They often resell some of the attention they get from their content to third parties (i.e. ads) as ads spliced into their videos. 

We'll try to answer some of these questions below by looking at a few Youtubers.  
1. How much of user attention should be resold?
2. What kind of third party content should fill the monetized attention? 
3. How much should third parties pay for the privilege of showing their content? 

## Does LinusTechTips have too many ads?
[@LinusTechTips](https://www.youtube.com/@LinusTechTips) is one of the top tech Youtubers who runs a multi-million dollar company primarily built on his Youtube channels.
A [recent rant](https://www.reddit.com/r/LinusTechTips/comments/1pztlu0/3_ad_segments_in_a_12_minute_video_is_insane/) on [r/LinusTechTips](https://www.reddit.com/r/LinusTechTips/) complained about too many ads (3 ad segments in a 13 minute video [about RAM prices](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRvyRo5Fk0o) posted on Dec 30th 2025).

The [SponsorBlock](https://sponsor.ajay.app) view shows that those ads take up about 23% of the video, not including the typical 2-3 15-30 seconds worth of Youtube-injected ads.
Is possibly watching up to 5 ads per video too much ads though?

![LTT 3ads sponsorblock view](/assets/posts/2026-01-06/LTT_3ads_sponsorblock.jpg)

If we listen to only the viewers' feedback then content creators will have no table on the food.
So what's the breakdown here and how much are these ads contributing to [@LinusTechTips](https://www.youtube.com/@LinusTechTips)'s top-line?

LTT doesn’t provide explicit figures but they’ve dropped a bunch of (publicly available) breadcrumbs for us:
* They did quoted a $100 million valuation figure for a potential acquisition back in 2023. This is typically a multiple of yearly revenue. The multiple for digital media can reach 10x. 
* In their [revenue breakdowns video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GeCP-0nuziE), we [see percentages](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GeCP-0nuziE&t=106). AdSense (i.e. Youtube-injected ads) only makes up about 14% of their revenue and that most of their revenue comes from their "merch" (i.e. products from their team, making up 55% of the revenue) and sponsorships (i.e. third party products or services, making up 21%). 
* Also in that video, some isolated Adsense figures were shown. Their biggest standard video earned [\$2k per million views](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GeCP-0nuziE&t=375) whereas their biggest "Short" earned only [$100 per million views](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GeCP-0nuziE&t=365).
* The channel had about [850 million views](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GeCP-0nuziE&t=447) so this means that AdSense can be up to ~$1.5 million. Since AdSense makes up 14% of revenue, we get a rough estimate of **yearly revenue at ~$10 million**, which aligns with the 10x multiple for their acquisition valuation figures in 2023.

Let's look at the ad spots again in the 13 minute video [about RAM prices](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRvyRo5Fk0o), which got 1.3 million views as of 2025-01-06 and assume (unrealistically) that their yearly revenue gets broken down proportionally by view counts:
1. DBrand, their channel sponsor: Sponsorships (21% of revenue) ~$2k
2. Clear LTT screwdrivers (merch, 55% of revenue) ~$10k
3. Private Internet Access: Sponsorships (21% of revenue) ~$2k
4. Adsense (14% of revenue) ~$1.3k

From LTT's perspective, they can expect up to $15k worth of revenue from the ads setup, so this absolutely makes sense!
So why don't they add more ads?

## How much is too much?
As we saw earlier, viewers often rant about watching too many ads.
But do they stop watching these videos or unsubscribe? 

There's little evidence to suggest that this is happening when looking at channel subscriber counts. The trend has pretty much being increasing for the last few years or so according to [SocialBlade.com](https://socialblade.com/youtube/handle/linustechtips).

![LTT Total subs increasing consistently](/assets/posts/2026-01-06/LTT_total_subs.png)

Around the time of release of the [video in question](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRvyRo5Fk0o) (i.e. Dec 30th 2025), there's certainly no dip in subscriber counts.
The only major dip in subscriber count was in 2023 July, when they were mired in controversy due to an expose by a competing Youtube channel, throwing their ethics into question and hurting viewer trust according to [this CBC report](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/linus-tech-tips-youtube-controversy-1.6940087).

*Aside: That being said, these counts could be artificially high because of viewers bypassing these ads. The most annoyed viewers may download ad blockers like [AdGuard](https://adguard.com/en/welcome.html) which skips Youtube-injected ads while others may install [SponsorBlock](https://sponsor.ajay.app) to skip parts of the video which are sponsored. But not everyone is motivated all the time on all devices so this point may be mostly moot (but Linus would still argue that [AdBlock is theft](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=a-PH2GUy_zM&t=71)).*

Even so, these are only proxy metrics for the revenue they derive from AdSense.
Sponsorship revenue, for example, is determined mostly by how much the advertiser is willing to pay for the ad placement.
This is in turn influenced by how much these companies' marketing department thinks the return on investment on that ad is going to be, details of which can start to get extremely hairy (a good metric here can be advertiser budgets).

Despite the complexity, the ability of the creator or platform to command ad revenue in the long term mainly stems from these factors:
1. Size of audience (i.e. subscriber count, view counts) (depends on content quality and content-platform fit)
2. ...multiplied by the amount of attention that can be commanded at the discretion of the creator or platform (i.e. watch time, video completion rate) (depends on content type and platform)
3. ...multiplied by the disposable income of audience and willingness to spend on related goods and services (i.e. demographics, geographical location, reported income) (depends on the content niche, language and cultural references etc)

While each creator or platform may have different ethical and sponsorship standards, their long term survival (if dominated by ads) is primarily determined by these factors above.
So long as ads do not pose a significant risk to the above factors, there's endless limit to *innovation*… Yikes! 

# Selling out with style and discretion
Assuming that the creators or platform decides to play the game of maximizing long term ad revenue, they’d want to optimize for these things 
1. Strategic ad placement - clustering these ads after the "hook" (when interest in the main content is high) and after the main content is a common strategy to balance watch times and ad load. This can also lead to sneaky ads for some less ethical channels. 
2. Increasing ads relevance - are users ok with seeing these ads? LTT viewers are typically tech enthusiasts and are already likely to be in interested in related topics such as DBrand phone cases (with phone circuit board skins), LTT screwdrivers (marketed as being built for PC builders) and PIA (vpn for the privacy conscious). Ads which are less relevant to the audience can reduce the ad volume however. For example, [this dyson sponsored video being one of the most disliked](https://www.reddit.com/r/LinusTechTips/comments/15i23rk/what_is_ltts_most_disliked_video/#:~:text=They%20didn't%20put%20it,would%20be%20nothing%20but%20Dyson.).

The ideal ad is one that is so relevant to viewers' interests so as to be indistinguishable from organic content. However, in this case, an advertiser wouldn't even need to pay for the content. So what gives?

# Goldilocks zone of relevance
We'll look at the relevance of third-party content from the advertiser's side.
I'll be using advertiser and 3P (third-party) interchangeably since they're the third-party from the perspective of the content creator and viewer relationship.
As such we can see ads as third party content which may be shown along with first party content (i.e. the video that users want to see) at the discretion of the content generator.

There's an equilibrium in terms of 3P content relevance as we'll break down later:
![Goldilocks zone of advertising](/assets/posts/2026-01-06/goldilocks_zone_of_advertising.png)

On the right side is what we discussed earlier.
Advertisers generally do not need to pay for 3P content that may be indistinguishable from organic content (e.g. new camera gear releases for a Youtube channel focusing on camera gear reviews).
In these cases, there may be concerns other than content relevance which dominates this segment of content (e.g. limited access to new product, company imposes embargo timelines due to testing variations).
Of note here is that what can be relevant organic content in on channel might be irrelevant content on another channel (e.g. content about dyson vacuums in a tech channel vs in a robovacs channel).

## Setting a baseline for 3P content 
From the content provider's perspective, it's much more reasonable to set a baseline for third party content. One such example comes from an indie tech Youtuber I enjoy, [@BeccaFarsace](https://www.youtube.com/@BeccaFarsace), who describes trust as being ["more valuable than any brand deal"](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PME4LZMDtK0&t=308). This observation is true regardless of whether you trust her as a person or that this just makes good business sense, since the amount of ad dollars you can command is directly influenced by the users who wants to watch the content. 

## Audience-based Relevance 
The base of relevance stems from what the viewers want to (or are okay with) watch.
As such, there are more forms of relevance than just the niche that the channel is focusing on.
