Why do you get the kind of ads that you do and why are there so many of them?
Is there no limit to the amount of ads they can stuff in your face?
Here we'll look at a few of my favourite Youtubers as examples of how content providers make these decisions.

# I've got some content in my ads!
*Disclaimer: these opinions do not reflect those of my employer and are mine alone*

The most popular content that we see today come with ads in some form.
As users, it's rather frustrating to have ads or sponsored content show up on your content feed.
But servers aren't free and ads are what incentivize people to produce and host content to entertain and/or inform you.

So what influences the quantity and type of ads you see? 

We'll first backtrack a bit my looking at how the modern ad-supported business model came about.
Then we'll take a look at my favourite Youtubers and see what hints they can give us about how to fit sponsored content into their videos.
Finally we can come up with a couple of principles that are broadly applicable to most ad-supported creators or platforms.

# How ads took over the world
The OG "content" used to be newspapers that people paid physical cash for, usually at the time of purchase.

![newspaper stands](https://inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2023/05/1336747_81_118551_mbaoiLBrD-889x593.jpg)

Some time in the 2000s though, "free" newspapers started gaining traction. 
These papers had substantially more ads than traditional paid newspapers, often with as much as 50% ads in the headliner articles.
Yet, they were popular since "free" is just too good of a deal and you'll still get something to do in the train.

## Online advertising 
As PCs, then later mobile phones and cellular plans caught on, newspapers started losing more ground to websites.
While some web content were locked behind a paywall, the most successful ones were those which just gave out content for free.
Most of their revenue came from ads instead, operating on a business model similar to the "free" newspapers that we talked about earlier.

This was also a time of some genuinely annoying pop-up ads and misleading buttons, which resulted in users being really annoyed with those websites, swearing to never visit them again... not without ad blockers!
These scummy websites relied on SEO and shady deals with other equally scummy webistes to maintain a stream of new and oblivious users who can be relied on to generate clicks for which they can earn ad revenue.

However, Google's [PageRank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank) algorithm, its successors as well as LLM web crawlers have increased the difficulty of diverting traffic to turd content.
Luckily for us, this means that most of the time, in order to make any money selling ads, you need to have good (enough) content to attract viewership.
But too much bad ads though, users start to flip the figurative table, click the ❌ button or maybe swear to never visit the website again.

*Aside: Online advertising also had the extra benefit of being attributable to purchase decisions, which newspaper ads weren't able to accomplish (not directly anyway, some ran surveys and questionnaires but you can image how that went). Ever heard of the old saying about marketing dollars, that "half of my marketing budget is wasted, but the problem is that I don't know which half"? Online advertising sells the promise that you can now tell which half is wasted... or can you? We'll talk about this in another post...*

# Users V Advertisers
It's certainly easy to stuff the entire webpage with ads as a quick way to maybe double or triple the ads revenue, but the gravy train would only run for a few days at most before users and search engines wise up to the sudden drop in content quality.
So how does one balance the need to sell out to pay the bills and the need to maintain or acquire an audiences with which to sell out?

Here's a rough sketch of (inter-related) decisions that need to be made:
1. How much of user attention should be resold?
2. What kind of ads should fill the monetized attention?
3. How much should advertisers pay for those ads?

Finally, how do we know if we're doing a good job?

Since these are often trade secrets, the details on how creators or platforms do this is often not available for scrutiny.
But some Youtubers (especially those who build their platform on trust and transparency) can be quite forthcoming with things like their revenue sources and dollars.
So we'll take a look at my favourite Youtube channels and how they make money.

# Youtubers and sponsored content
Youtubers tend to run ads on their videos on top of the platform inserted ads. They are a proxy of content platform because of these similarities:
1. They need to maintain viewership with some core audience segment in order to establish consistent and valuable viewership. 
2. They often resell some of the attention they get from their content to third parties (i.e. ads) as ads spliced into their videos. 

We'll try to answer some of these questions below by looking at a few Youtubers.  
1. How much of user attention should be resold?
2. What kind of third party content should fill the monetized attention? 
3. How much should third parties pay for the privilege of showing their content? 

## Does LinusTechTips have too many ads?
[@LinusTechTips](https://www.youtube.com/@LinusTechTips) is one of the top tech Youtubers who runs a multi-million dollar company primarily built on his Youtube channels. However, a [recent post](https://www.reddit.com/r/LinusTechTips/comments/1pztlu0/3_ad_segments_in_a_12_minute_video_is_insane/) on [r/LinusTechTips](https://www.reddit.com/r/LinusTechTips/) complained about too many ads (3 ad segments in a 13 minute video). I believe they're referring to [this video about RAM prices](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRvyRo5Fk0o) posted on Dec 30th 2025. Looking at the [SponsorBlock](https://sponsor.ajay.app) view, we can see that those ads took up about 23% of the video.

![LTT 3ads sponsorblock view](/assets/posts/2026-01-06/LTT_3ads_sponsorblock.jpg)

But what's [@LinusTechTips](https://www.youtube.com/@LinusTechTips)'s view on this ad load? In their [revenue breakdowns video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GeCP-0nuziE), we see that Youtube ads (i.e. AdSense) only makes up about 14% of their revenue and that most of their revenue comes from their "merch" (i.e. products from their team, making up 55% of the revenue) and sponsorships (i.e. third party products or services, making up 21%). 

Breaking down the 3 ad spots (not including Youtube injected ones i.e. AdSense, 14% of revenue), we find the top 2 revenue sources: 
1. DBrand, their channel sponsor (sponsorships, 21% of revenue)
2. Clear LTT screwdrivers (merch, 55% of revenue)
3. Private Internet Access (sponsorships, 21% of revenue)

From LTT's perspective, these 3 ad slots make absolute sense. From viewers' perspective though, perhaps even one ad may seem too much for some (hence the existence of ad blockers like [AdGuard](https://adguard.com/en/welcome.html) and services such as [SponsorBlock](https://sponsor.ajay.app)), so the question for us regarding user needs is really "how harmful is having these 3 ads for users"? 

The evidence we can find here (other than the [post ranting about 3 ads in 12 minutes](https://www.reddit.com/r/LinusTechTips/comments/1pztlu0/3_ad_segments_in_a_12_minute_video_is_insane/)) is minimal. For example, there are no signs that the channel subscriber counts have been negatively affected by that video posted on Dec 30th 2025 according to [SocialBlade.com](https://socialblade.com/youtube/handle/linustechtips).

![LTT Total subs increasing consistently](/assets/posts/2026-01-06/LTT_total_subs.png)

So the answer seems to be no! However, this comes with some caveats:
1. Positioning of these ads - clustering these ads after the "hook" (when interest in the main content is high) and after the main content is a common strategy to balance watch times and ad load. 
2. Relevance of the ads to the viewer - are users ok with seeing these ads? LTT viewers are typically tech enthusiasts and are already likely to be in interested in related topics such as DBrand phone cases (with phone circuit board skins), LTT screwdrivers (marketed as being built for PC builders) and PIA (vpn for the privacy conscious). Ads which are less relevant to the audience can reduce the ad volume however. For example, [this dyson sponsored video being one of the most disliked](https://www.reddit.com/r/LinusTechTips/comments/15i23rk/what_is_ltts_most_disliked_video/#:~:text=They%20didn't%20put%20it,would%20be%20nothing%20but%20Dyson.).

The ideal ad is one that is so relevant to viewers' interests so as to be indistinguishable from organic content. However, in this case, an advertiser wouldn't even need to pay for the content. So what gives?


## How do we know if we're doing a good job

*Aside: User and advertiser retention can be measured as a measure of success for the balancing act described above. For example, user and advertiser churn (i.e. inactivity after X days) are typically bad outcomes whereas increased user time spent on the platform, increased weekly/monthly user counts as well as advertiser budgets can be perceived as positive outcomes.*


# Goldilocks zone of relevance
We'll look at the relevance of third-party content from the advertiser's side.
I'll be using advertiser and 3P (third-party) interchangeably since they're the third-party from the perspective of the content creator and viewer relationship.
As such we can see ads as third party content which may be shown along with first party content (i.e. the video that users want to see) at the discretion of the content generator.

There's an equilibrium in terms of 3P content relevance as we'll break down later:
![Goldilocks zone of advertising](/assets/posts/2026-01-06/goldilocks_zone_of_advertising.png)

On the right side is what we discussed earlier.
Advertisers generally do not need to pay for 3P content that may be indistinguishable from organic content (e.g. new camera gear releases for a Youtube channel focusing on camera gear reviews).
In these cases, there may be concerns other than content relevance which dominates this segment of content (e.g. limited access to new product, company imposes embargo timelines due to testing variations).
Of note here is that what can be relevant organic content in on channel might be irrelevant content on another channel (e.g. content about dyson vacuums in a tech channel vs in a robovacs channel).


## Setting a baseline for 3P content 
From the content provider's perspective, it's much more reasonable to set a baseline for third party content. One such example comes from an indie tech Youtuber I enjoy, [@BeccaFarsace](https://www.youtube.com/@BeccaFarsace), who describes trust as being ["more valuable than any brand deal"](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PME4LZMDtK0&t=308). This observation is true regardless of whether you trust her as a person or that this just makes good business sense, since the amount of ad dollars you can command is directly influenced by the users who wants to watch the content.

## Audience-based Relevance 
The base of relevance stems from what the viewers want to (or are okay with) watch.
As such, there are more forms of relevance than just the niche that the channel is focusing on.
