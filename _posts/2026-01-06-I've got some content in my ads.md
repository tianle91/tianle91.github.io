Why do you get the kind of ads that you do and why are there so many of them?
Here we'll look at some Youtubers to see how they make these decisions.

# I've got some content in my ads!
*Disclaimer: these opinions do not reflect those of my employer and are mine alone*

The most popular content that we see today come with ads in some form.
As users, it's rather frustrating to have ads or sponsored content show up on your content feed.
But servers aren't free and ads are what incentivize people to produce and host content to entertain and/or inform you.

![two unskippable ads](https://img-9gag-fun.9cache.com/photo/aoy6oDX_700bwp.webp)

So what influences the quantity and type of ads you see? 

We'll do a quick recap of how ads took over the world over the last couple of decades.
In order to understand what kind of ads and how many get shown, we'll poke a bit into the revenue of some Youtubers and see what drives sponsored content on their channels.

# How ads took over the world
The OG "content" used to be newspapers that people would pay for at newspaper stands with coins.
Now ads are everywhere and all three entities mentioned in the previous sentence can be considered as endangered species.

Coincidence? I think not!

![newspaper stands](https://inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2023/05/1336747_81_118551_mbaoiLBrD-889x593.jpg)

I think it all started some time in the 2000s, with "free" newspapers starting to show up with the paid ones.
Commuters started grabbing those over newspapers you'd have to pay for, even though these papers had substantially more ads.
However, it's pretty hard to beat "free", especially since the breaking news would show up on every single newspaper anyways.
The innovation here is that the revenue of these "free" newspapers comes primarily from the advertisers instead of the readers, thereby allowing these papers to scale viewership much faster than paid newspapers.

## Online advertising 
At the same time, PCs (later mobile phones and cellular plans) were also gaining popularity such that even these free newspapers started losing ground to websites.
The most visited websites operated on very similar ad-supported models, giving out content in exchange for putting some ads on the webpage that the users might click on.

Some of the scummy websites gained notoriety for flooding their pages with annoying pop-up ads and misleading buttons.
Users would often avoid these websites entirely, although they might still brave these traps and snares if they wanted the content bad enough.
Even then, we intuitively understood that the amount and type of ads on the website is related to the kind of content the website hosts...

![internet ads](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1300/0*jnk0_FJWQf_7Z4j4.jpg)

These ads underwent a major evolution, going from ad hoc partnerships between websites (i.e. publishers) and advertisers (i.e. marketers) to a whole slew of automated bidding and attribution systems over the last couple of decades.

*Aside: Online advertising also enabled user tracking, promising marketers that FINALLY, they'll be able to tell which half of their marketing spend was wasted. But realizing this promise always seemed to be one technical innovation away. We'll talk about this in another post...*

However, this amount of technical complexity is not necessary to understand what kind of ads and what type of ads gets shown to you.
Let's start by looking at Youtubers instead.

# Youtubers and sponsored content
Youtubers these days often allow Youtube itself to inject ads to their videos.
On top of those ads, many of those with big followings also run sponsored content.
We'll focus on the latter as a way to understand what dynamics influence their decisions and hopefully we can see that the same dynamics also affect larger players like Google search and Youtube ads.

## Does LinusTechTips have too many ads?
[@LinusTechTips](https://www.youtube.com/@LinusTechTips) (i.e. LTT) is one of the top tech Youtubers who runs a multi-million dollar digital media company making money from these Youtube channels.

A [recent rant](https://www.reddit.com/r/LinusTechTips/comments/1pztlu0/3_ad_segments_in_a_12_minute_video_is_insane/) on [r/LinusTechTips](https://www.reddit.com/r/LinusTechTips/) complained about too many ads (3 ad segments in a 13 minute video [about RAM prices](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRvyRo5Fk0o) posted on Dec 30th 2025).
The [SponsorBlock](https://sponsor.ajay.app) view shows that those ads take up about almost 1/5th of the total video length, excluding the typical 2x 15-30s worth of Youtube-injected ads.

![LTT 3ads sponsorblock view](/assets/posts/2026-01-06/LTT_3ads_sponsorblock.jpg)

## How much is LTT earning per ad?
If we listen to only the viewers' feedback then content creators will have no table on the food.
Clearly, these ads are only there because they benefit LTT.
So what's the breakdown here and how much are these ads contributing to [@LinusTechTips](https://www.youtube.com/@LinusTechTips)'s top-line?

LTT doesn’t provide explicit figures but they’ve dropped a bunch of (publicly available) breadcrumbs for us:
* They did quoted a $100 million valuation figure for a potential acquisition back in 2023. This is typically a multiple of yearly revenue. The multiple for digital media can reach 10x. 
* In their [revenue breakdowns video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GeCP-0nuziE), we [see percentages](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GeCP-0nuziE&t=106). AdSense (i.e. Youtube-injected ads) only makes up about 14% of their revenue and that most of their revenue comes from their "merch" (i.e. products from their team, making up 55% of the revenue) and sponsorships (i.e. third party products or services, making up 21%). 
* Also in that video, some isolated Adsense figures were shown. Their biggest standard video earned [\$2k per million views](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GeCP-0nuziE&t=375) whereas their biggest "Short" earned only [$100 per million views](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GeCP-0nuziE&t=365).
* The channel had about [850 million views](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GeCP-0nuziE&t=447) so this means that AdSense can be up to ~$1.5 million. Since AdSense makes up 14% of revenue, we get a rough estimate of **yearly revenue at ~$10 million**, which aligns with the 10x multiple for their acquisition valuation figures in 2023.

Let's look at the ad spots again in the 13 minute video [about RAM prices](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRvyRo5Fk0o), which got 1.3 million views as of 2025-01-06 and assume (unrealistically) that their yearly revenue gets broken down proportionally by view counts:
1. DBrand, their channel sponsor: Sponsorships (21% of revenue) ~$2k
2. Clear LTT screwdrivers (merch, 55% of revenue) ~$10k
3. Private Internet Access: Sponsorships (21% of revenue) ~$2k
4. Adsense (14% of revenue) ~$1.3k

From LTT's perspective, they can expect **up to $15k worth of revenue** from these ads, which absolutely explains why these ads are there... so why don't they add more ads?

# Long term ads revenue depends on viewers
The growth of viewership is essential to the long term viability of those ads on the Youtube channel.
Higher viewership is directed related to influence that LTT can choose to resell to advertisers who may be interested in telling viewers about their newest product or service.

Too many ads would risk the channel losing viewership and thereby influence, resulting in fewer advertisers who want to have an opportunity to get featured in an LTT video.
Revisiting the topic of [3 ad segments in a 12 minute video](https://www.reddit.com/r/LinusTechTips/comments/1pztlu0/3_ad_segments_in_a_12_minute_video_is_insane/), we can see little evidence of a dampening to their long term subscribership around the time of video release on Dec 30th 2025 according to [SocialBlade.com](https://socialblade.com/youtube/handle/linustechtips).

![LTT Total subs increasing consistently](/assets/posts/2026-01-06/LTT_total_subs.png)

The only major dip in subscriber count was in 2023 July, when they were mired in controversy due to an expose by a competing Youtube channel, throwing their ethics into question and hurting viewer trust according to [this CBC report](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/linus-tech-tips-youtube-controversy-1.6940087).

*Aside: These counts could be lower if ad blockers like [AdGuard](https://adguard.com/en/welcome.html) (skips Youtube-injected ads) or [SponsorBlock](https://sponsor.ajay.app) (skips sponsored segments) do not exist. When LTT pitches to advertisers, it would be in their interest to point to these counts without the above caveat.*

## But it also depends on advertisers
Somewhat counter-intuitively, viewership is more a measure of cost rather than revenue for Youtubers.
High quality content, while almost always correlated with high viewership, is certaintly guaranteed to burn a hole in the pocket.

Luckily for us LTT has another video, detailing that [an average video might take up to 60 hours](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us7qSE44XOg) of work to produce.
Assuming that their staff gets paid $20 per hour, this means a lower limit of $1800 per video (good thing they seem to come out profitable!).

![60 hours of work per video](/assets/posts/2026-01-06/LTT_hours_of_work_per_video.png)

The hole needs to be balanced out by ad revenue if the Youtube channel has any hope of being able to continue making content in the long term.
So how do marketers or advertisers decide how much money to throw at Youtube channels?

If you've heard of the [Drake equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_equation), the answer is surprisingly simple:

> Amount of marketing dollars ~ Number of Views * Probability of Purchase per View * Amount of Revenue per Purchase

However, also similar to the [Drake equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_equation), the real complexity arises in the terms of the equation itself instead of the equation. 
* Number of Views - It's usually hard to predict how much views the video will get prior to the video release, although proxies such as subscriber count and viewership of similar past videos can be good alternatives.
* Probability of Purchase per View - This is the incremental probability of purchase, compared against the baseline of not spending this marketing budget. This can be difficult to do perfectly, which is why there's typically a discount code that Youtubers will ask you to use (an a small discount to incentivize you to use it) so that their marketers can attempt to measure this effect. 
* Amount of Revenue per Purchase - High ticket items such as cars can justify higher marketing budgets, which is why some automotive Youtubers do not need as much views to survive.

Here's the sneaky part - Youtubers are still incentivized to drive more sales for advertisers because doing so successfully means higher marketing budgets in the future (if the marketers are also doing a good job)... without losing viewers, that is.

*Aside: For LTT, it is in their interest to discourage their viewers from using ad blockers (e.g. by claiming [AdBlock is theft](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=a-PH2GUy_zM&t=71)) even if they risk alienating their viewers.*

# When is an ad not an ad?
Fixing the above variables, the last element of the game is to increase the amount of ad slots in the video. 
Going back to the topic of [3 ad segments in a 12 minute video](https://www.reddit.com/r/LinusTechTips/comments/1pztlu0/3_ad_segments_in_a_12_minute_video_is_insane/), we see that LTT went with the two strategies to increase viewer retention:
1. Strategic ad placement - clustering these ads after the "hook" (when interest in the main content is high) and after the main content is a common strategy to balance watch times and ad load. This can also lead to sneaky ads for some less ethical channels. 
2. Relevant and high quality ads - ideally the ads are relevant to the users. LTT viewers are typically tech enthusiasts and are already likely to be in interested in related topics such as DBrand phone cases (with phone circuit board skins), LTT screwdrivers (marketed as being built for PC builders) and PIA (vpn for the privacy conscious). Ads which are less relevant to the audience can reduce the ad volume however. For example, [this dyson sponsored video being one of the most disliked](https://www.reddit.com/r/LinusTechTips/comments/15i23rk/what_is_ltts_most_disliked_video/#:~:text=They%20didn't%20put%20it,would%20be%20nothing%20but%20Dyson.).

The ideal ad is one that is so relevant to viewers' interests so as to be indistinguishable from organic content. However, in this case, an advertiser wouldn't even need to pay for the content. So what gives?

## Strategic ad placements
Not all ads are created equal
TODO 

## Relevant and high quality ads
We'll look at the relevance of third-party content from the advertiser's side.
I'll be using advertiser and 3P (third-party) interchangeably since they're the third-party from the perspective of the content creator and viewer relationship.
As such we can see ads as third party content which may be shown along with first party content (i.e. the video that users want to see) at the discretion of the content generator.

There's an equilibrium in terms of 3P content relevance as we'll break down later:
![Goldilocks zone of advertising](/assets/posts/2026-01-06/goldilocks_zone_of_advertising.png)

On the right side is what we discussed earlier.
Advertisers generally do not need to pay for 3P content that may be indistinguishable from organic content (e.g. new camera gear releases for a Youtube channel focusing on camera gear reviews).
In these cases, there may be concerns other than content relevance which dominates this segment of content (e.g. limited access to new product, company imposes embargo timelines due to testing variations).
Of note here is that what can be relevant organic content in on channel might be irrelevant content on another channel (e.g. content about dyson vacuums in a tech channel vs in a robovacs channel).

### Setting a baseline for 3P content 
From the content provider's perspective, it's much more reasonable to set a baseline for third party content. One such example comes from an indie tech Youtuber I enjoy, [@BeccaFarsace](https://www.youtube.com/@BeccaFarsace), who describes trust as being ["more valuable than any brand deal"](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PME4LZMDtK0&t=308). This observation is true regardless of whether you trust her as a person or that this just makes good business sense, since the amount of ad dollars you can command is directly influenced by the users who wants to watch the content. 

### Ads that you might not skip right away

### Audience-based Relevance 
The base of relevance stems from what the viewers want to (or are okay with) watch.
As such, there are more forms of relevance than just the niche that the channel is focusing on.
